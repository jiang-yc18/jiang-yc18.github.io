Welcome to my website! I am a MS candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Tsinghua University, advised by Professor [Hua Guo](https://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1173/1683.htm). 

My research interest lies in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisition and reconstruction, with a particular focus on diffusion imaging technique development. Currently, I am also working with Professor [Berkin Bilgic](https://martinos.org/~berkin/) at [Martinos Center](https://www.martinos.org/) on developing advanced ghost correction methods for multishot diffusion MRI.

You can find my CV [here](/files/CV_Yuancheng_Jiang.pdf).
